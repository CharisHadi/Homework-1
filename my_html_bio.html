                 With minimal background in coding, Charis is mainly an epic gamer who's gone on an indefinite hiatus from higher learning. Looking to drift away from videogaming, he has peaked in interest in rock climbing and a beginning into low level blacksmithing and jeweling. Currently working as a waiter, he is seeking to leave the food service industry to pursue higher salary, lower physical labor, and more creative freedom. Ultimately wishing to branch into AI development or Game Development, he has little to no conception of how he is to attain those goals past the bootcamp in present states.
